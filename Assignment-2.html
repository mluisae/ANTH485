            <p>For this task, I participated (where possible) to three website that have crowdsourcing activities for the public. Each were more or less similar in the way their activities were presented and in the ways people are able to contribute. I attempted and completed a transcribing and photo-masking task on MicroPasts, a transcription for the Royal BC Museum Transcribe, while the Historic England task is a different story. Reviews of these tasks and the website can be found below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">MicroPasts</h2>

            <p>MicroPasts had a simple website design that was clear to follow and concise with the information about the projects. The first task I tried was transcribing a postcard from their collection and from there I would have to fill in the date, message, select a possible language (if not recognized), provide a translation (if possible), an address, and the opportunity to add in any comments about the postcard. The task seemed simple enough with the only difficult part of having to read the handwriting that can be illegible at times while being in a language I was not too familiar with. There was a postcard that was written in French and having studied the language before, it was easier to transcribe although there were areas of uncertainty when reading the handwriting and being less proficient with French now, leaves me unable to understand most of it. The photo-masking task was more time-consuming as you had to outline an object but only portions at a time, so I was unable to finish the whole photo-masking task.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Royal BC Museum</h2>

            <p>The Royal BC Museum Transcribe also has a short and concise introduction to the task and what it is about. It also shows pictures of the papers that would need to be transcribed. Similar to the MicroPasts transcribing task, depending on which page you get to transcribe it can be a hit or miss with how much you will be able to transcribe. Even though this one was in English, I continued to have difficulty in being able read and decipher the handwriting. When finished or completed as much as possible, it saves what was transcribed and indicates it as “Needs Review” and others are able to edit and add on to it if necessary.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading"Historic England</h2> 
            
            <p>The Historic England website varied in many ways from the previous two tasks. It provided a lot of information about the task – too much information that it felt less coherent to the task. I did not contribute to the List as I am not familiar with places they require and did not want to sign up for another site. However, a good part of contributing that I found was the contributor leaderboard as it can increase the amount of contributions through competition. Also I believe that those contributing would enjoy having credit being giving towards them for their photos and information.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading"Final Thoughts</h2>
            
            <p>Of the crowdsourcing tasks, I believe that I would return to the transcribing tasks. It seems more like a task that I would be able to do and it would not have to take too long depending on what was chosen to transcribe. I do like having the option of being able to contribute without having to sign up; I feel like I would return to either MicroPasts or the Royal BC Museum Transcribe for their transcription tasks but seeing that I did not contribute to Historic England, I probably will not return to that website.</p>

            <p>After countless trial and errors, it may look as though I'm getting the hang of this whole HTML & CSS thing. Although I'm off to a good start, don't let looks fool you as I still have a lot to work on. For my first Critical Self Reflection I will be discussing what I felt while making my website and how I feel about it at this stage.</p>

            <p>Before I begin, I would like to give credit to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> as their tutorials on HTML, CSS and Git were extremely helpful in being introduced to coding. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Learning to Code</h2>

            <p>A few summers ago I tried to teach myself how to code. There wasn't any motive in particular that made me want to learn; I thought it was cool and that it was a handy skill to learn. Unfortunately, I didn't get very far in teaching myself but at least now I'm actually learning it now.</p>

            <p>I was able to complete 4 tutorials on Codecademy (HTML, CSS, Git, and Make Your Own Website). Even though doing tutorials and semi-coding my own webste is quite different from each other, doing as many tutorials as I did made it a little easier to make the website my own.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Creating the Website</h2>

            <p>The website that you're currently veiwing is based off of a theme from the Bootstrap website and from there I was able to upload the theme into Github and begin making it my own.</p>
            
            <p>When I was choosing a theme, I wanted to choose one that would easy to customize, clean, and easy to navigate. The <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/">Creative</a> theme was able to do just that. There is still a lot that I need to modify but I feel confident I'm off to a decent start.</p>
            
            <p>The most difficult part for me is understanding and getting used to HTML and CSS. Making sure the code is in the right place is one of my biggest issues but I know that over the course of the senester I'll be able to gain plenty of practice with this.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Successes and Notes for Moving Forward</h2> 
            
            <p>I think having this website up and running is already a success in itself as I was not entirely sure of how it would go. Even though I kept most of the basic elements of the template, they will most likely change as I continue to work on the website throughout the semester. I do like having the option to scavenge for code and being able to utilize it in our websites (with given credit of course) but also having the knowledge of being able to code is a skill that I believe is highly useful and can open up many avenues in future endeavors.</p>
            
            <p> In context with this course and relating it to digital archaeology, I believe that this is a great way to engage with the digital world and share our thoughts with the public. I tend to be more of a social media hermit as I only use a couple of platforms but having the opportunity to create something that can contribute and give us a headstart on our professonal careers in anthropology, makes me feel as though as I should possibly be doing more to expand my reach. I hope to get better at this and continue to use this even when the semester is over and be more engage with social media.</p>

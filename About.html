            <p>Hello! I'm Luisa Esteban and currently I am a 4th year student at the University of Victoria, majoring in Anthropology and minoring and Art History and Visual Studies. Since I was a kid, I was always interestng in the arts and sciences so studying anthropolgy is a good balance between the two. </p>

            <p></p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">From Far and Wide</h2>

            <p>To begin, I was born in Winnepeg, MB, lived in Ottawa, ON, and currently live in Yellowknife, NT before coming to Victoria and at one point I did live in the Philippines. I come from a variety of places, each with their own qualities that made me call them home and if I were to pick a favourite, I would probably pick Victoria.</p>
            
            <p>A question I would usually be asked (aside from "Is Yellowknife in the Yukon?") is "Why did you choose to come to Victoria?" and personally that is a very easy question.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">So Why Did I Choose to Come Here?</h2>

            <p>I decided to come here because I loved being in BC and I heard that the program is pretty great. I knew that I didn't want to go to many other schools for my undergraduate degree and I also didn't want to go to a school where a lot of my high school friends were going (there are only a few at UVic) and it wasn't because they were bad friends, I wanted to be able to meet new people and experience most things on my own.</p>
                       
            <h2 class="section-heading">My Hopes for this Blog</h2> 
            
            <p>I'm relatively new to the whole scope of blogging (in this format), using HTML & CSS, but being able to learn all these skills makes me feel a little more confident in knowing that I can apply these skills to possible careers one day. I hope to learn well and I know that I will be able to take away plenty of skills from this Portfolio Project.</p>
            
            <p>There are projects here and there I hope to have completed soon and have up on the website. Thank you and stay tuned!</p>

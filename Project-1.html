            <h2 class="section-heading">Final Porfolio Project</h2>
            
            <p>For this final portfolio piece, I decided to expand on my final class project of using Aurasama, the augmented reality app. Through the final project we were able to connect features of the past in the First Nations archaeological sights of Victoria. While receiving all the positive feedback, it was both motivating and interesting to see the reactions people had when we showed them how to interact with our posters. </p>

            <p>This portfolio project expands on the previous project while deviating from it in the sense that it will be centred around myself and my connections to certain places in Victoria. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading"></h2>
            
            <p>As someone who moved here roughly four years ago for school, I have narrowed down seven places to which I have certain ties to. I have various places located downtown, the Clearihue building at UVic, and Cadboro Bay beach.</p>
            
            <p>To create a personalized tour or something similar, that would guide people around the places I enjoy being the most, would have been preferred and by using augmented reality, they would be able to see the historical significance each area has at the same time.</p>
            
            <p>I can personally see there being a lot more potential with this project if there could have been more time to work on and refine it but I think it currently would be able to get the general idea across for the moment.</p>
            
            <p>Although I do enjoy being downtown, out of all of the places, Cadboro Bay and the building at UVic are the most important to me at this point. Cadboro Bay is only a few minutes away by walking and I am always able to feel my stress and anxieties wash away as I look out to the water. The Clearihue building was one of the first buildings that I had classes in when I first started here at UVic, making it an icon for an important milestone in my life.</p>
            
            <p>I understand how this deviates entirely from the original project as we were working with Victoriaâ€™s past and for this project I chose to use to reflect on the last four years of my life. If I were to do this project again, I would possibly take the more recent photos that are overlayed myself and take more time to describe why each place is important for me, that way it would truly get a more personal feel.</p>
            
            <p>I did enjoy using the RBCM archives when looking for the photos of the areas in the past and Aurasama is a great app to use when getting started with augmented reality. I hope to continue trying these kinds of methods and applications as they can be used for a large range of projects and I will be focusing on more anthropology/archaeology projects if I do continue.</p>
